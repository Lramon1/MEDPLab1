      A student pursuing Studio Art major and looking for more related to it. One day I just realized that I was able to draw many things more easily than others, so it became a goal for me to improve my skill. Also, I wanted to learn more about art and feed my knowledge.In my early teens, around 13, I experimented with Canva to do covers for school projects or for whatever topic I was interested in at that moment. During high school, I was in an internship called Creative Art Works, where I learned how to use Photoshop and a little of Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
