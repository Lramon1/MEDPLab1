<p>A student pursuing Studio Art major and looking for more related to it. One day I just realize that I was able to draw many things more easily than others, so it became as a goal for me to improve my skill. Also, I wanted to learn more about art and feed my knowledge. In my latest 13 or even early, I experimented with Canva to do covers for projects of my school or for wherever topic that I was interested in, at that moment. During High School, I was in an internship called Creative Art Works, where I learned how to use Photoshop and a little of Adobe Premier Pro.
