In Plato’s Cave

Susan Sontag’s essay In Plato’s Cave, from On Photography (1977), begins with an impacting idea, that is to collect photographs is to collect the world. Since the start, she invites us to think about how images shape not only our memory but also our sense of reality itself. In other words, manipulate our perception of the world, what surrounds us. She connects photography to Plato’s allegory of the cave, where human beings mistake shadows on a wall for truth. Sotang states that the photographs are shadows that became the reality of what the world looks or is to us. 
What resonates with me most in this essay is the way Sontag describes photographs as both powerful and dangerous. On one hand, they are evidence; they stop time, preserve memories, and allow us to access events we were never part of. On the other hand, they are selective, framed, and ultimately incapable of telling the entire story. This contradiction makes me reflect on how easily we accept an image as truth, without questioning what is outside the frame. 
Sontag’s words also connect with the world I live in today. With social media, photographs have become not only a way of documenting life but also a way of constructing identity. All of us choose which images to share, carefully caring how we want to be seen. In that sense, we are all trapped in our own “caves,” looking at filtered realities. It makes me wonder how much of what I believe about others, or even about myself, comes from these shadows on a digital wall. It's not the same to experience with all our senses that just experience watching something with our eyes. 
Reading this essay also made me think about the responsibility of images, and how we need to be careful with them. When we see photographs of suffering, violence, or poverty, we are moved for a moment, but then we scroll past them. Sontag suggests that photographs can desensitize us, turning reality into something aesthetic, consumable, and distant. I recognize this in my own life,  there are times that the TV or online show heartbreaking images. I empathize for a moment but it is a short lasting feeling because it easily  fades into the endless stream of content. It makes me realize how important it is not only to look at images but instead investigate and engage critically with them.
At the same time, I also feel the beauty in what Sontag describes. Photographs may never be complete truths, but they hold emotional power. The memories that I made with people close to me like my family, my friends, and moments I do not want to forget. Even though Sontag is critical, I think she also acknowledges this undeniable pull of photography. That keeps alive a part of memories and truth. 
In Plato's Cave essay teaches me to balance admiration with caution. Photographs are not reality, but they can guide me closer to understanding it if I approach them carefully. Like Plato’s prisoners stepping outside the cave, I need to be willing to go beyond appearances. Sontag challenges me not just to consume images but to question them, to see both what they show and what they leave out.
