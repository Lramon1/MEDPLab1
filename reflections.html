Susan Sontag’s essay In Plato’s Cave, from On Photography (1977), begins with an impacting idea, that is to collect photographs is to collect the world. Since the start, she invites us to think about how images shape not only our memory but also our sense of reality itself. In other words, manipulate our perception of the world, what surrounds us. She connects photography to Plato’s allegory of the cave, where human beings mistake shadows on a wall for truth. Sotang states that the photographs are shadows that became the reality of what the world looks or is to us. 
What resonates with me most in this essay is the way Sontag describes photographs as both powerful and dangerous. On one hand, they are evidence; they stop time, preserve memories, and allow us to access events we were never part of. On the other hand, they are selective, framed, and ultimately incapable of telling the entire story. This contradiction makes me reflect on how easily we accept an image as truth, without questioning what is outside the frame. 
Sontag’s words also connect with the world I live in today. With social media, photographs have become not only a way of documenting life but also a way of constructing identity. All of us choose which images to share, carefully caring how we want to be seen. In that sense, we are all trapped in our own “caves,” looking at filtered realities. It makes me wonder how much of what I believe about others, or even about myself, comes from these shadows on a digital wall. It's not the same to experience with all our senses that just experience watching something with our eyes. 
Reading this essay also made me think about the responsibility of images, and how we need to be careful with them. When we see photographs of suffering, violence, or poverty, we are moved for a moment, but then we scroll past them. Sontag suggests that photographs can desensitize us, turning reality into something aesthetic, consumable, and distant. I recognize this in my own life,  there are times that the TV or online show heartbreaking images. I empathize for a moment but it is a short lasting feeling because it easily  fades into the endless stream of content. It makes me realize how important it is not only to look at images but instead investigate and engage critically with them.
At the same time, I also feel the beauty in what Sontag describes. Photographs may never be complete truths, but they hold emotional power. The memories that I made with people close to me like my family, my friends, and moments I do not want to forget. Even though Sontag is critical, I think she also acknowledges this undeniable pull of photography. That keeps alive a part of memories and truth. 
In Plato's Cave essay teaches me to balance admiration with caution. Photographs are not reality, but they can guide me closer to understanding it if I approach them carefully. Like Plato’s prisoners stepping outside the cave, I need to be willing to go beyond appearances. Sontag challenges me not just to consume images but to question them, to see both what they show and what they leave out.

The article talks about how our visual world is now split into two channels: the real and the artificial. On one side, we have real images about news, politics, and things that actually are and happen in the world. On the other hand, there’s what the author calls “AI garbage,” a flood of images created by artificial intelligence that mix fantasy, propaganda, and meaningless content in media content. While I was reading I was just thinking of how true it is. Often when I do dumb scrolling at least one video is made by AI and sometimes does not make any sense. Personally for me it's annoying  to watch these kinds of videos. The worst thing is that sometimes this content can look perfectly convincing.
What makes me think twice is the idea that AI is not just producing harmless fantasy, but also spreading political manipulation. Often I watched something dumb about Trump and his ideals. For me, all those kinds of videos are absurd because I know that in the long term it can be detrimental, but not everyone thinks like me. There will always be people more vulnerable, easy to persuade and people that agree with these ideals. The text mentions right-wing fantasies, AI-generated memes, and images used to make propaganda feel nostalgic or comforting. It’s scary because this content doesn't have a clear author or responsibility behind it. Anyone can create and share these images, and they travel fast through apps like WhatsApp, where people, especially older ones, trust what they receive. 
The professor Roland Meyer says that generative AI is “structurally conservative,” which means it reproduces what already exists. It’s trained with biased data, so the results often show white, straight, traditional ideals, and erase diversity. That part made me think about how technology keeps reproducing the same kind of beauty and “normality” we see everywhere. The idea that AI is creating an “aesthetic of fascism” feels extreme, but after seeing the examples, I understand why. It’s about how nostalgia can be used to make inequality look beautiful or natural.
I also felt something deeper when the author talked about desensitization. We are surrounded by so many shocking or emotional images, some real, some fake; that our ability to feel empathy weakens. Sometimes, I scroll through videos of war or tragedy, and after a while, I just keep going. It’s not that I don’t care; it’s that the flood never stops. The essay helped me understand that this overload is part of a system that keeps us entertained but disconnected at the same time.
In the end, I think the author is warning us not only about technology but also about ourselves. We are participating in this cycle by consuming, liking, and sharing. Even official accounts and journalists can post AI-generated images and it isn't safe to see what is real or not. It makes me think that maybe the problem is not only the existence of AI, but the way we’ve accepted that everything can become content. Reading this made me to be even more critical, to slow down, and to question what I see and help my close people to also do the same thing.

This Graphic Novel by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager and Saidu Bah portrays the lives of women in Sierra Leone. Every story varies from each other but has so much in common at the same time. Each story relates how difficult a woman's life can be due to ignorance and beliefs that the people have over there. Shows how women can be despised for not being the ideal woman, someone strong, able to have healthy kids, strong enough to grow without dying and at the same time be a decent and proper person.All of the stories are heartbreaking for me but Tetteh’s story really hit something in me. She is a woman who arrives in prison three months pregnant, and her story narrate the extreme social and legal pressures faced by women in Sierra Leone. This story shows how woman that face legal problems can be abandoned by their family or friends. Making their situation more worst. We can see this in the story due to the illustrations that allow readers to feel Tetteh’s fear, isolation, and resilience in a way that text or photography alone could not convey. Through expressive lines, stark shading, and symbolic imagery, her emotional state becomes immediately visible. For instance, the cramped and dim prison cell is drawn in a way that exaggerates the space’s confinement, visually reflecting her sense of isolation and vulnerability.
Illustration provides flexibility that photography cannot. While a photograph freezes a single moment, an illustration can compress multiple experiences into one frame, showing both Tetteh’s physical circumstances and her emotional struggles simultaneously. A drawing of the prison walls towering over her small figure communicates power dynamics and societal judgment in a manner that words alone cannot. Color and contrast further enhance the narrative, with muted or dark tones emphasizing despair and danger, while moments of lighter hues highlight fleeting hope or inner strength.
Moreover, illustrations bridge the gap between realism and empathy. Text can describe Tetteh’s situation, and photographs can document the physical environment, but illustrations merge narrative and artistry to evoke a visceral emotional response. For example, an illustration of Tetteh clutching her stomach, her expression a mix of fear and determination, immediately draws the reader into her experience, fostering empathy and understanding. By portraying both physical and emotional dimensions of her struggle, illustrations make Tetteh’s story more immersive and compelling.
